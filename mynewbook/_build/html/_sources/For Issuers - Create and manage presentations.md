Navigating to the **Project Overview** page will give you real-time, running analytics of a live presentation:
1. Navigate between overviews of different projects that you have created
2. Adjust the filters here to get a more targeted, granular slice of information on the dashboard
	- Filter dashboard analytics by **Geography**; Regions, Country
	- Filter dashboard by the investor **Segment**, i.e. insurance, asset managers (hedge funds), etc. 
3. Toggle between these tabs for a view or all investors or 'ESG' focused ones only 
4. You may also create a new project by clicking on **'+Add'**

### Manage Project - Project details
![*Manage Project - Details*](attachment:Snode-issuer-prj-details.png)
Under **Manage Projects**, you can edit the project details and control the status of your project (tip: important!). 
1. Click on **'Edit'** to update your project setup details such as name, description, project duration reminder, and the use of the Q&A module  
2. The status of the project can be controlled here:
	- **Private**: This is the default status for new projects, a safe state for the project team to setup the presentation. The project is only accessible by the project team and cannot be accessed by others even with a deal code that was circulated before
	- **Live**: Changing the status to live will make it accessible by any user that has a deal code for that project 
	- **Closed**: Changing the status to closed will signal that the project team wishes to end the project. It will no longer be accessible by users with the deal code and Marketnode support will reach out to you to initiate the billing process
3. In the **Deal code** text field, enter your desired deal code for the project. Distribute this deal code to dealers, platforms, and investors to grant them access to the presentation in this project
